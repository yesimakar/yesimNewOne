## Determining your Node version

Being able to switch between Node versions quickly was really helpful while developing, n is a really handy program that makes switching between Node versions effortless.

``` Node version the project supports is 12.0.0 ```

```
# Install a program called n that will let us easily switch between Node versions.
sudo npm install -g n

# Changing to a specific version
# You need a specific version 12.0.0 the project is waiting to be run
# Simply specify the version number you want like this as below:
sudo n 12.0.0

```

## Usage

After initial **project prerequisites**, below steps should be followed;

`Make sure you're in the project directory.`

#### Installation of project dependencies
```
# When you're running npm run setup in the project's root, 
it installs all of the npm dependencies into the project's node_modules directory.
npm run setup
```

#### Running the server and viewing the project on locally
```
# You should be able to start the http-server by running the following from your project's root directory
